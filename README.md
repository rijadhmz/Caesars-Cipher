## Caesar's Cipher

This project involves a plain JavaScript implementation of a Caesar's Cipher. It was developed as part of the FreeCodeCamp "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" course certification.

### Project Description

The Caesar's Cipher, also known as a shift cipher, involves shifting the meanings of letters by a fixed amount. A common example is the ROT13 cipher, where letters are shifted by 13 places. This project focuses on implementing a function to decode a ROT13 encoded string.

### Challenge Requirement

**Challenge:** Write a function that takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

**Additional Requirements:**
- All letters will be uppercase.
- Non-alphabetic characters (spaces, punctuation) should not be transformed, but they should be passed on unchanged.

### Example

- Input: "SERR PBQR PNZC"
  Output: "FREE CODE CAMP"

### Technologies Used

- Plain JavaScript

This project demonstrates the application of simple encryption and decryption techniques using JavaScript logic.
